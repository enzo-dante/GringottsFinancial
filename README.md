# Functional Impacts:
1. Using Python and Tableau, build a report of borrowers who may have issues paying back the loan.

# QA Reminders:
1. I used the Spyder python IDE via the Anaconda-Navigator application to write, test, & execute the python script.
2. manually modified csv as excel & changed the column names that contained a "." with "_", then re-imported into tableau public

The link to published tableau dashboard for testing below:



# Acceptance Criteria:
1. write an MVP that extracts bank loans data from a json file
2. write a script that will export a clean excel file with new columns
3. use tableau to SQL join multiple datasets together to produce the relevant meaning and visualize your findings into a publicly-published dashboard that can filter the dataset
